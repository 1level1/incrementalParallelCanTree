This work focuses on using tree based structure for parallel and incremental mining. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm is using a combination of two techniques. As a high-level overview, the PFP~\cite{li2008pfp} algorithm is the base algorithm for parallel mining and CanTree~\cite{leung2005cantree} as the base structure for incremental updates.

As far as we know, this is the first algorithm proposing to use the advantages of tree structures for parallel and incremental mining. In this article, we will present the algorithm, review results comparing to most common parallel and incremental tree mining algorithms, discuss the pros and cons of this approach and propose practical usages.
