\section{Improvements}
While developing and testing the algorithm, 2 main obstacles prevented from using larger datasets and smaller minSupport:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Memory - Tree size.
	\item Computation Time - Tree order.
\end{enumerate}

To handle these obstacles, 2 techniques were implemented.
To handle the computation time, an approach similar to~\cite{tanbeer2009efficient} was tested. Although the size of the tree was not effected by more than 10\%, computation time was improved by XXX.

To handle the memory limitation, which is caused by the construction of a large tree, a partial approach of AFPIM~\cite{koh2004efficient} was implemented. We added a pre-min support to identify pre-frequent items, and tested performance while re reading the full dataset for missed items when those are found. 
Using this approach we were able to run synthetic datasets of 100M transactions and 1M unique item sets. The results can be seen in XXX compared to PFP.
