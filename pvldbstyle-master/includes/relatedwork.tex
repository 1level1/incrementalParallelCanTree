\section{RELATED WORK - Add more about FP and Apriori data}



  One of the most well known algorithms for mining association rules is the Apriori algorithm~\cite{agrawal1994fast}. This algorithm is iteratively generating candidates and pruning items with low support at each step. The correctness of this algorithm is based on the provided prove that an item of length N is frequent, then all sub patterns must be frequent as well. Using that idea, an early prune of non-frequent itemsets removes many unnecessary candidates in later iterations. An example is provided in \autoref{fig:aprioriexample}
  
In the year 2000, a tree based solution was introduced, FPGrowth algorithm and structure~\cite{agrawal1994fast}. This algorithm removes the need for candidate generation and yields better performance~\cite{hunyadi2011performance}. A small example is provided in \autoref{fig:fpgrowthexample}
